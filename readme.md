## Outside resources
*Your list of outside resources go here*

## 3 Unique inputs
*You don't have to list all inputs, just 3 unique ones.

## Packages
*List the name of any packages you add to your project that do not come with Laravel by default; this should include, but is not limited to, barryvdh/laravel-debugbar*

## Code style divergences
*list any divergences from PSR-1/PSR-2 and course guidelines on code style*

## Notes for instructor
*Any notes for me to refer to while grading; if none, omit this section*
