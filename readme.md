## 3 Unique inputs
*You don't have to list all inputs, just 3 unique ones. The following is an example of what I'd put if my project was the xkcd Password Generator: (1) Text input to indicate number of words in password, (2) Checkbox to indicate whether to include a number (3) Dropdown to indicate what symbol to include*

## Packages
